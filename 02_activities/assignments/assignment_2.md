# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      Good visualization: Kathryn McCrindle - Wildlife Strikes Link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kathryn.mccrindle/viz/IV2025FinalDashboard-KathrynMcCrindle-WildlifeStrikes/Home
      The visualization illustrates the trend of wildlife strikes over time, the parts of the plane that were struck, and the species most commonly involved. It is an effective visualization, as it meets aesthetic, substantive, and perceptual criteria well. The layout is both appealing and well-organized, using a plane diagram to vividly show which parts of the aircraft were struck, along with the line plot and bar chart to reflect time trends and species ranking. In terms of data accuracy and representation, the visualization draws from a credible source, the FAA Wildstrike Database, and allows users to explore strike counts by aircraft part, year, and species through interactive features. Different numbers of strikes are visually expressed through variations in point size or position on the plots, further aiding interpretation. For the perceptual standpoint, the message is clearly conveyed. The varying sizes of points on the plane diagram effectively highlight which areas experience the most strikes, making it easy for the audience to interpret the data visually rather than relying solely on text. The line plot clearly shows trends over time, while the bar plot makes it easy to compare the most frequently involved species.
      Bad visualization: Dan Wade - Formula 1 2024 | Lap Times Beeswarm Link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vizgrowth/viz/Formula12024LapTimesBeeswarm/Beeswarm
      The visualization illustrates lap times from each race across the entire Formula 1 season using a beeswarm plot. It performs well in terms of aesthetic and substantive criteria. The plot is visually appealing, particularly due to the varied dot colors that make it eye-catching. It also identifies the data source and includes detailed information, such as the driver, lap number, and lap time, via interactive features. Each cloud of points represents a single race, accompanied by relevant statistics including total laps, average time, and fastest time.
      However, despite its visual impact, the high density of over 20,000 overlapping dots makes it difficult to distinguish individual data points or discern patterns, which can be overwhelming for viewers and detracts from message clarity. While the pop-up box provides useful details, additional contextual information is needed to guide viewers, especially those unfamiliar with Formula 1, on what each dot and color cluster represents. This information is not immediately apparent and requires exploration to fully understand the visualization‚Äôs intent. Moreover, although the ‚Äúfastest‚Äù and ‚Äúslowest‚Äù labels help orient viewers, they are not sufficient for interpreting exact lap time positions. A viewer may recognize that one mark is relatively faster than others, but cannot determine how much faster it is.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
      Good visualization:
      The visualization can be improved in a few ways. First, for the plane diagram, it would be helpful to add a short title to the plot, similar to what was done for the strike trends by time and species. This would make the topic of the plot more immediately clear. Second, for the line plot, adding a title to the x-axis (for example, ‚ÄúIncident Year‚Äù) would improve clarity. Including horizontal grid lines would also make it easier to read the values. Third, for the bar chart, adding an axis on the side to indicate the scale of strikes would be beneficial. While the current design makes it easy to compare the rankings of different species at a relative level, it is difficult to tell the absolute number of strikes at a glance. Additionally, including icons of the wildlife for each bar could make the chart more engaging. This would help the audience quickly identify the types of species involved in strikes and visualize whether they are birds, mammals, or other species.

      Bad visualization:
      A few strategies could be used to improve the clarity of the visualization. First, consider adding a color legend to indicate which cloud corresponds to which Grand Prix, or use a filter or slider to limit the number of visible races to reduce visual overwhelm. Anchoring the beeswarm plot along the baseline (fastest to slowest line) and overlaying a density plot could also improve readability, as it would make it easier to see where most lap times cluster. Adding numeric markers or a scale on the baseline would further help viewers interpret lap times, rather than simply identifying whether a time is relatively fast or slow. In addition, the summary statistics shown for each cloud currently include total laps, average, and fastest time; it would also be helpful to include the slowest lap time, especially since individual dots are small and difficult to interpret. Lastly, adding a brief caption or introductory text explaining what the visualization shows, how to read it, and what insights users might gain would support a broader audience in understanding the display.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
